* If you want to be adventurous enter your favorite cocktail modifier, these are ingredients which are added to the base alcohol to give the drink the desired flavor and smoothness, such as fruit juices, or ingredients like eggs or cream which lend a smooth quality to the cocktail. 

* The following step is then a simple click of the Submit button.

* Your page will be populated with an array of cocktail images, and ingredients required to make that drink. There is also description for the method of preparation, and a recommended glass type to get the most out of your cocktail, be it in aesthetics or flavor.
